<b>CALL FOR TRAINERS (CfT) & SUBMISSION  </b>

The Programme Team is formally issuing a call for Trainers, opening <b>January 27,  2020</b>. 

As with previous Global AppSec events, we would like to run a number of different training courses of varying lengths over the three days of the conference.

Trainers can apply to give 1, 2, or 3 day classes. Trainers are allowed to make multiple applications; one application per class. The training audience will include developers interested in security as well as security professionals.

We are looking for training courses at all levels from someone new to the application security field to advanced topics for experienced professionals. However, all training submissions should have a focus on practical skills which are immediately applicable to an attendeeâ€™s job and have a significant hands-on element with tasks and exercises for attendees to attempt during the training.
